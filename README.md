### Continuous Integration with Jenkins and Tools

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to regularly commit their code changes to a shared repository. Each commit is then automatically built, tested, and integrated into the software build. This helps identify errors and conflicts early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of bugs and errors in the final product.

This project aims to implement a CI process using Jenkins and other tools to automate the build, test, and release cycle. By automating these processes, developers can get real-time feedback on their code changes, and bugs can be caught early in the development cycle.....


### Scenario

In an Agile team, developers regularly make code changes, which need to be tested and built. In larger enterprises, there may be a separate build and release team responsible for this process. However, if this process is manual, it can be slow and error-prone.

With this project, developers can have an automated build and release process that builds and tests the code for every commit. The output is a well-tested artifact that can be deployed to servers for further testing.

## Benefits of Continuous Integration

- Early detection of errors and conflicts
- Improved code quality
- Faster feedback for developers
- Reduced time and effort in fixing bugs
- Increased productivity and efficiency
- Better collaboration among team members


### Tools Used 

-	Jenkins (For continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery): The Jenkins server will be running on an EC2 instance.
-	SonarQube (For code analysis)
-	Maven (To build the artifact)
-	Git (Version control) 
-	Nexus Sonar type Repository (for the artifact storage and download)
-	Slack – For Notification
- JUnit: A unit testing framework for Java programming language
-	AWS CLI – for authentication. Jenkins will use the cli together with access key and secret key to authenticate into AWS to create resources. 


### Flow of Execution 

- Setting up the Jenkins server: Install and configure Jenkins on a dedicated server or in the cloud.
- Creating a pipeline: Create a pipeline using the Jenkins pipeline syntax to automate the build, test, and release process.
- Integrating with Git: Configure Jenkins to monitor the Git repository for code changes.
- Building and testing the code: Configure Jenkins to build and test the code for every commit.
- Notification and feedback: Configure Jenkins to notify developers of build failures, bugs, and errors.


## Conclusion

By implementing a CI process using Jenkins and other tools, developers can have a more efficient and reliable build, test, and release cycle. This can help improve the quality of the final product and reduce the time and effort spent in fixing bugs and errors.
